# Integral-Calculator
This is the second side project that I initiated after my first semester Python class. It uses the drafter and dataclasses packages to create a web-based integral calculator. Unfinished.

## Getting Started
To get started with running this program, you will need the 'drafter' and 'dataclasses' packages (See Prerequisites). You will also need to be able to access the 'Coding Integral Calculator.py' file and run it through your chosen application. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system (n/a).

## Prerequisites
You will need:
- Python 3.12.1 (recommended)
- PyPI (Python Package Index https://pypi.org/)
    - dataclasses 0.8 (run "py -m pip install dataclasses")
    - drafter 0.2.0 (run "py -m pip install drafter")
- A way to run *.py files with packages installed

## Installing
- dataclasses 0.8 (run "py -m pip install dataclasses")
- drafter 0.2.0 (run "py -m pip install drafter")
